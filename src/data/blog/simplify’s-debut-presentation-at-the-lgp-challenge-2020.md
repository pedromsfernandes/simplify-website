**PORTO, Portugal.** Simplify is excited to announce that it is going to partake in its first public event, the “Let’s Get Public Challenge” hosted by FEUP on the 3rd of July 2020 to present company and products while referencing its relevance to the sustainable development goals by the UN, which has been chosen as the event’s annually changing theme.

Under its narrative title, *“Simplifying Everyday Life for a Sustainable Future”,* Simplify will provide the audience with an immersive and interactive experience sharing its vision, mission, values and products in a creative fashion.

> “Following the Sustainable Development Goals as a company is hugely important for the environment. Simplify will address their involvement and signature goals during a hands-on experience between company and audience to start a conversation and share their vision.” 
>
> \- Andrè Ramada, CEO

The presentation will focus on the company's mission to help remove the burden of everyday tasks and help promote a better understanding on unapparent topics by incorporating audiovisual performances, relatable experiences, a close connection to the audience and role play during the showcase to establish an open minded experience that creates a conversation rather than a one sided presentation.

> “Twinkling lights, a rumbling whisper that turns silent as the projector fades in portraying an image on the auditorium’s screen. This is not a movie theater, but the brisk adrenaline rush of a live public speaking event partnered with an interactive multimedia presentation. This is Simplify at the LGP Challenge 2020.”

> \- Aisha Jeanette Animashaun, CMO
