We can say that it is responsible for our perception of the world, since it is responsible for the functioning of our body and the execution of locomotive, reasoning and memory activities. Without it, walking, talking or even moving your head can be impossible to do.

Therefore, keeping our CNS up and running should be a priority when performing everyday tasks, such as looking for something on the home shelf, but we do not always perceive dangers in these actions because they are apparently simple. This is what the [NeuroPal game](https://simplify-lgp.tech/products/neuropal/) highlights: the magnitude that small actions poorly executed can bring to our SNC.

The fun game produced by Symplify in partnership with the association [Viver a Ciência](http://www.viveraciencia.org/pt/) and [Institute of Molecular Medicine](https://imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/#) of Lisbon, made for use on mobile devices and with easy gameplay, NeuroPal allows players to learn about important CNS functions. Focused on making the player aware of the care and consequences of small decisions during a search for items essentials to escape from a tropical island.

An experience for the whole family, an intuitive game that exemplifies situations to which we are exposed and do not perceive as a danger to our CNS. In addition, the game has a quiz that will teach clearly and objectively what are the parts of the CNS and its functionalities and when answering the player will reconnect the CNS of his friend NeuroPal.

Have fun and learn to take care of yourself! Share with us what you think of the game and what lessons you learned from it!
