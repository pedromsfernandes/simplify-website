From the nature of our company to its core, we are a multidisciplinary team from various backgrounds. Every project has the collaboration of [members from different departments](https://simplify-lgp.tech/team). This encourage us to learn from each other and allow us to apply our different set of skills to work together on better solutions to our clients and our products.

Our team is not only multidisciplinary, but also multicultural. A considerable part of our team is portuguese, but we additionally have Brazilian professionals and even an Austrian CMO. We have members who speak not only english and portuguese but spanish, german, dutch and a little bit of italian as well. This plurality makes our work environment and our daily exchanges even richer and provides a space where we can learn new things and exchange experiences in a way that benefits not only our team members but also our products.
